# NoPainLearn (无痛学)

This project is a Scenario-Based Learning Platform designed to transform static knowledge into immersive dialogues.

## Design Philosophy
Based on the guidelines from `为什么你用AI开发的网站AI味儿那么浓？`, this application avoids generic "AI Aesthetics":
- **Color Palette:** Uses "Stone" and "Paper" tones (`#f5f5f0`) for a warm, editorial feel instead of the standard "Dark Blue/Purple".
- **Typography:** Mixes Serif headings with Sans-Serif body text for better hierarchy.
- **Layout:** Asymmetric, document-style chat bubbles rather than uniform rounded pills.

## Features
- **Scenario Player:** An interactive step-by-step dialogue viewer.
- **Demo Content:** Includes a pre-loaded scenario "Escaping the AI Look" based on the provided knowledge base.
